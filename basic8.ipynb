    "PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias `pyip` (or sometimes `pypi`) for brevity and convenience. Here are a few reasons why this alias is often used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shorter and easier to type: The name `pyinputplus` is quite long, and using `pyip` or `pypi` as an alias reduces the amount of typing required to use the library. It makes the code more concise and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Avoiding namespace conflicts: By using an alias, you can prevent potential naming conflicts with other modules or variables in your code. It ensures that there won't be any clashes if you have other modules or variables with similar names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consistency with common convention: Using `pyip` or `pypi` as an alias for PyInputPlus follows a common convention in the Python community. It is a widely recognized and understood alias that many developers use when working with PyInputPlus.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using an alias is not required, it is a common practice to improve code readability and maintainability. It's worth noting that you can choose any alias you prefer as long as it adheres to Python's variable naming rules."
